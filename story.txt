John was walking down Langdon Street on his way to a party at his academic fraternity. It was a cold Thursday night, and he had a bunch of code to do, but he also wanted to go outside and meet up with his friends, so this is what he was doing instead.

He planned to leave the party around 12am so that he could have time to finish his code before the due time, which is tomorrow 9 o'clock in the morning. However, things weren't going as he thought. His friends talked him into a drinking game,and he had several huge cups of beer in just half. By the time he is supposed to leave, he felt that he wasn't able to walk and his head is really really dizzy.
He did not write any code that night. He planned to get up early to write his homework. As a result of drinking too much, he could not get up next morning. He missed his due.
